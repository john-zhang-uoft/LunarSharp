# NeuralSharp

A native C# neural network library in progress.


Latest update: August 1, 2021 - Data encoder bug fixes, DataLoader class, TrainLog class.


My goal is to create a working high level C# neural network library with basic functionality (for fun)! I'm not following any tutorials that provide any code so that I can hone my fundamental neural network knowledge and practice creating a well-structured design.
Performance is not a top priority (otherwise C# would not be the language of choice), however, making computations within C# efficient is.

Plans:

1. Implement softmax activation and categorical cross entropy loss.
2. Implement convolutional layers.
3. Implement dropout layers.
4. Add optimizers.
5. Implement automatic differentiation.
