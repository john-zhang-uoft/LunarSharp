# NeuralSharp

A native C# neural network library in progress.

The goal is to create a useable C# neural network library with basic functionality (for fun)! I'm not following any tutorials that provide any code so that I can hone my low level ML knowledge and practice creating a well-structured framework.

Plans:

1. Implement convolution
2. Implement dropout
3. Add optimizers
4. Implement automatic hyperparameter tuning
